Rate limiting is a strategy for limiting network traffic. It puts a cap on how often someone can repeat an action within a certain timeframe – 
for instance, trying to log in to an account. Rate limiting can help stop certain kinds of malicious bot activity.
It can also reduce strain on web servers. However, rate limiting is not a complete solution for managing bot activity.
